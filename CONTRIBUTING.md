## Fixing Bugs

This project welcomes pull requests to fix bugs!

If you see a bug report that you'd like to fix, please feel free to do so.
Following the directions and guidelines described in the "Adding New Features"
section below, you may create bugfix branches and send pull requests.

## Adding New Features

If you have an idea for a new feature, it's a good idea to check out the
[issues][] or active [pull requests][] first to see if anyone is already working
on the feature. If not, feel free to submit an issue first, asking whether the
feature is beneficial to the project. This will save you from doing a lot of
development work only to have your feature rejected. We don't enjoy rejecting
your hard work, but some features don't fit with the goals of the project.

When you do begin working on your feature, here are some guidelines to consider:

* Your pull request description should clearly detail the changes you have made.
  We will use this description to update the CHANGELOG. If there is no
  description, or it does not adequately describe your feature, we may ask you
  to update the description.
* `phoneburner/api-handler` follows a superset of **[PSR-12 coding standard][psr-12]**, and all pull requests must
  comply with the coding standard
  Please ensure your code does, too. _Hint: run `make phpcs` to check._
* Please **write tests** for any new features you add.
* Please **ensure that tests pass** before submitting your pull request.
  `phoneburner/api-handler` automatically runs tests for pull requests. However,
  running the tests locally will help save time. _Hint: run `make phpunit`._
* **Use topic/feature branches.** Please do not ask to pull from your main branch.
    * For more information, see "[Understanding the GitHub flow][gh-flow]."
* **Submit one feature per pull request.** If you have multiple features you
  wish to submit, please break them into separate pull requests.

## Developing

To develop this project, you will need [PHP](https://www.php.net) 8.2 or greater
and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). This project has a standardized Docker
development environment that is recommended for any one contributing to this
project. Composer is used as a script-runner inside of the container, and `make`
is used externally from the host environment to run most of the common scripts.

After cloning this repository locally, execute the following commands:

``` bash
cd /path/to/repository
make
```

The full suite of code quality tools can be run in one command:

```bash
make ci
```

### Static Analysis

This project uses [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) to provide static analysis of PHP
code. You may run static analysis manually across the whole codebase with the
following command:

``` bash
# Static analysis
make phpstan
```

### Coding Standards

This project follows a superset of [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)
coding standards, enforced by [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).
Rector is also used to enforce code quality and standards

``` bash
# Run the code standards linter
make phpcs

# Attempt to auto-fix coding standards issues
make phpbf

# Run Rector with project configuration
make rector
```

### Running Tests

The following must pass before we will accept a pull request. If this does not
pass, it will result in a complete build failure. Before you can run this, be
sure to `composer install`.

To run all the tests and coding standards checks, execute the following from the
command line, while in the project root directory:

```
make phpunit
```
